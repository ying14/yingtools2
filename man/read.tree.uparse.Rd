\value{
Returns a \code{phylo} object, with original labels.

\description{
Read in tree file created by uparse pipeline.
}
\details{
Functions like \code{read.tree} have trouble reading uparse-generated trees, because the OTU names contain semicolons(;), e.g. "\code{'OTU_2080;size=5;'}". This function temporarily replaces \code{;} with \code{__}, reads in successfully, and reverts back to names with semicolons. Also, removes the single quotes (\code{\'}) from the name. If read in this way, the tree can be quickly merged into a phyloseq object.

\examples{
b <- import_biom("uparse/total.8.otu-tax.biom")
tr <- read.tree.uparse("uparse/total.10.tree")
phy <- merge_phyloseq(b,tr)
