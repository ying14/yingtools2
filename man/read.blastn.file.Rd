\title{Read in tax file from blastn output}
\usage{
read.blastn.file(tax.file, tax_table = TRUE)
}
\arguments{
\item{tax_table}{logical, if TRUE (default), will return a data frame of taxonomy, which can be directly converted to a phyloseq tax_table object. If FALSE, returns data frame with all hits and associated data.}

\item{tax}{Taxonomy data from blastn, either as the file or a data frame.}
}
\value{
Data from the blastn data file.
}
\description{
This reads in the file created by the YT python script, blastn.py
}

evalue: Expect value. Describes the number of hits one can "expect" to see by chance when searching a database of a particular size.
It decreases exponentially as the Score (S) of the match increases. Essentially, the E value describes the random background noise.
For example, an E value of 1 assigned to a hit can be interpreted as meaning that in a database of the current size one might
expect to see 1 match with a similar score simply by chance.
