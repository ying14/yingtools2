\title{Extract Phyloseq sample_data}
\usage{
get.samp(phy, stats = FALSE, measures = c("Observed", "InvSimpson", "Shannon"))
}
\arguments{
\item{phy}{phyloseq object containing sample_data}

\item{stats}{logical, whether or not to include summary statistics of samples. Stores \code{nseqs}, and diversity metrics.}

\item{measures}{diversity measures to calculate, if stats is TRUE. Default: c("Observed","InvSimpson","Shannon")}
}
\value{
Data frame containing \code{sample_data} data.
}
\description{
Returns \code{sample_data} component from phyloseq object, as a data frame.
}
\details{
This basically is similar to the function \code{phyloseq::sample_data}, but does a few extra things.
(1) Converts to a data frame
(2) The sample name is stored in a column called \code{sample}. (\code{phyloseq} normally stores as a row name)
(3) Calculates number of sequences and alpha diversity metrics, if desired.
This function is the opposite of \code{set.samp}, which converts the data frame back into a \code{sample_data}.
Note that if the \code{phyloseq} object does not contain \code{sample_data}, a data frame containing a single column, \code{sample}, is returned.
